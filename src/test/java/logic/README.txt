Logic classes have to be tested because they do the heavy lifting for the program

I'm not testing UImanager now because it just handles printing.
Can easily verify for now

Main things to test:
TaskList, Storage, Validator

Parser mainly depends on validator so i think due to time constrains i'm not testing it yet.
